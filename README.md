### 2. Add MCP Configuration to Claude Desktop

Open Claude Desktop settings and add this configuration to the MCP section:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "irs-tax-filing-buddy": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/Users/navaneethkumarbuddi/Desktop/irs-tax-filing-buddy/dist/server.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "production"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: Update the path to match your actual project location.

### 3. Restart Claude Desktop

After adding the configuration, restart Claude Desktop for the changes to take effect.

### 4. Test the Connection

Once connected, you can ask Claude to use your tax tools:

- "Who are you?" (uses `whoAreYou` tool)
- "Calculate tax for $50,000 income as single filer" (uses `calculateTax` tool)
- "What are the filing deadlines for 2024?" (uses `getFilingDeadline` tool)
- "Tell me about filing statuses" (uses `getFilingStatusInfo` tool)
- "Help me with tax deductions" (uses `getTaxAssistance` tool)

### Troubleshooting

- **JSON parsing errors**: Make sure the server is built (`npm run build`)
- **Server disconnected**: Check that the file path in the configuration is correct
- **Tools not available**: Restart Claude Desktop after adding the configuration
