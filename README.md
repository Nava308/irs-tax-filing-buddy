      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/Users/navaneethkumarbuddi/Desktop/irs-tax-filing-buddy/dist/server.js"
      ],

- "What are the filing deadlines for 2024?" (uses `getFilingDeadline` tool)
- "Tell me about filing statuses" (uses `getFilingStatusInfo` tool)
- "Help me with tax deductions" (uses `getTaxAssistance` tool)

### Troubleshooting
